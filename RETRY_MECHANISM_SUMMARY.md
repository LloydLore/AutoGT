# AI API Retry Mechanism - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The AI API retry mechanism has been successfully implemented and validated.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Retry Logic** (3 attempts)

- First attempt: Immediate execution
- Retry attempts: Only triggered on API failures
- Maximum retries: 3 attempts per asset

### 2. **Exponential Backoff**

- Attempt 1: No wait (immediate)
- Attempt 2: 2 seconds wait (2^1)
- Attempt 3: 4 seconds wait (2^2)

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging**

Each stage of the retry process is logged:

- `🚀 Calling AI API (with up to 3 retry attempts)...`
- `⏳ Waiting for AI response... (Attempt X/3)`
- `🔄 Retry attempt X/3 for asset: [name]`
- `⏳ Waiting Xs before retry...`
- `❌ AI API call failed (Attempt X/3): [error]`
- `💥 All 3 retry attempts exhausted`

### 4. **Graceful Fallback**

- Per-asset fallback: If one asset fails, others continue
- Explicit user notification:

  ```
  ⚠️ AI analysis failed after 3 retries for [asset name]
  🔄 Falling back to rule-based identification...
  ```

- Rule-based threats are still generated

### 5. **Error Handling**

- Transient errors (network issues, rate limits): Retried
- Persistent errors (authentication, location restrictions): Falls back after 3 attempts
- JSON parsing errors: Retried with same logic

## 📊 Real-World Test Results

### Success Case (CAN Bus, Infotainment System)

```
INFO  🚀 Calling AI API (with up to 3 retry attempts)...
INFO  ⏳ Waiting for AI response... (Attempt 1/3)
INFO  ✅ Received AI response
INFO  ✅ Successfully parsed 3 threats from AI
```

### Retry Case (OTA Update Module - Location Error)

```
ERROR ❌ AI API call failed (Attempt 1/3): Error code: 400
WARNING 🔄 Retry attempt 2/3 for asset: OTA Update Module
INFO ⏳ Waiting 2s before retry...
INFO ⏳ Waiting for AI response... (Attempt 2/3)
ERROR ❌ AI API call failed (Attempt 2/3): Error code: 400
WARNING 🔄 Retry attempt 3/3 for asset: OTA Update Module
INFO ⏳ Waiting 4s before retry...
INFO ⏳ Waiting for AI response... (Attempt 3/3)
ERROR ❌ AI API call failed (Attempt 3/3): Error code: 400
ERROR 💥 All 3 retry attempts exhausted
ERROR ❌ All retry attempts failed for asset OTA Update Module
      ⚠️ AI analysis failed after 3 retries for OTA Update Module
      🔄 Falling back to rule-based identification...
```

## 📁 Modified Files

1. **`src/autogt/services/autogen_agent.py`**
   - Added `max_retries` parameter to `identify_threats()`
   - Implemented retry loop with exponential backoff
   - Added comprehensive logging at each step

2. **`src/autogt/cli/commands/threats.py`**
   - Updated `_ai_threat_identification()` to handle per-asset failures
   - Added explicit user notifications for retries and fallback
   - Created `_rule_based_threat_identification_for_asset()` helper

3. **`src/autogt/lib/config.py`**
   - Fixed Gemini API endpoint URL
   - Added support for multiple API key environment variables

## 🧪 Test Files Created

1. **`tests/manual/test_retry_mechanism.py`**
   - Unit tests for retry logic
   - Fallback mechanism validation

2. **`tests/manual/demo_retry_mechanism.py`**
   - Interactive demonstration
   - Documentation and examples

## 🎓 Usage Example

```python
# The retry mechanism is automatic - no code changes needed!
# Just run the threat identification command:

autogt threats identify <analysis_id> --ai-mode
```

The system will:

1. Try to call the AI API
2. If it fails, wait 2s and retry
3. If it fails again, wait 4s and retry
4. If all 3 attempts fail, fall back to rule-based approach
5. Notify the user at each step

## ✨ Benefits

- **Resilience**: Handles transient network issues automatically
- **User-friendly**: Clear feedback about what's happening
- **Non-blocking**: One asset failure doesn't stop analysis of others
- **Fallback guarantee**: Always produces results, even if AI fails
- **Production-ready**: Proper error handling and logging

## 🔍 Validation Status

✅ Real API calls with retry tested and working
✅ Exponential backoff verified (2s, 4s waits)
✅ Logging at each step confirmed
✅ Fallback mechanism validated
✅ Per-asset error handling tested
✅ User notifications clear and informative
