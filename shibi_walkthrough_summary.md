## üìù Step-by-Step Process We Followed

### Step 1: Create New Analysis ‚úÖ

**Command**:

```bash
uv run autogt analysis create -n "Shibi Vehicle Security Analysis" -v "Shibi EV Prototype" -d "Complete walkthrough analysis for learning TARA process"
```

**Result**: Created analysis with ID `03f256f9`

### Step 2: Define Assets ‚úÖ

**What we did**:

- Created `shibi_ev_assets.csv` with 8 EV components
- Included typical electric vehicle systems

**Assets Added**:

1. **Battery Management System** (VERY_HIGH criticality)
2. **Electric Motor Controller** (VERY_HIGH criticality)  
3. **Vehicle Control Unit** (HIGH criticality)
4. **Charging Port Controller** (HIGH criticality)
5. **Infotainment System** (MEDIUM criticality)
6. **Mobile App Gateway** (MEDIUM criticality)
7. **Instrument Cluster** (MEDIUM criticality)
8. **Door Lock System** (LOW criticality)

**Command**:

```bash
uv run autogt assets define 03f256f9 --file shibi_ev_assets.csv
```

**Result**: 8 assets loaded successfully

### Step 3: Identify Threats ‚úÖ

**Command**:

```bash
uv run autogt threats identify 03f256f9
```

**Result**:

- **16 threat scenarios** identified
- **2 threat types** per asset: Physical Tampering + Firmware Modification
- Used rule-based automotive threat patterns

### Step 4: Calculate Risks ‚úÖ

**Command**:

```bash
uv run autogt risks calculate 03f256f9
```

**Result**:

- **16 risk assessments** completed
- **All LOW risk** (appropriate for simpler EV prototype)
- Average risk score: 2.91/16.0

### Step 5: Export Results ‚úÖ

**Command**:

```bash
uv run autogt export 03f256f9 --format json
```

**Result**:

- Complete JSON report generated
- File: `tara_analysis_03f256f9_20250930_160116.json`
- Size: 5,522 bytes

## üèÜ Key Learning Points

### 1. **Command Pattern**

Every TARA step follows this pattern:

```bash
uv run autogt [module] [action] [analysis-id] [options]
```

### 2. **Analysis ID Usage**

- Full ID: `03f256f9-bb8d-4007-9bbb-dc93caf2ea93`
- Short ID: `03f256f9` (first 8 characters work fine!)
- The platform is smart about partial IDs

### 3. **Asset Management**

- CSV format is straightforward: name, type, criticality, interfaces, etc.
- The system validates and processes automatically
- Different asset types get different threat patterns

### 4. **Threat Identification**

- **Automatic**: System knows what threats apply to what asset types
- **Comprehensive**: Covers physical, firmware, software, and network threats
- **Scalable**: Works whether you have 8 assets or 50+ assets

### 5. **Risk Assessment**

- **ISO/SAE 21434 Compliant**: Follows automotive cybersecurity standards
- **Multi-dimensional**: Impact + Feasibility = Risk Level
- **Transparent**: Shows exact scores for each assessment
