## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: For concurrent TARA analysis sessions (FR-12), what are the system limits? ‚Üí A: Single session only (one active analysis at a time per user)
- Q: For audit trail data retention (FR-13), what are the requirements? ‚Üí A: 3 years (standard business records retention)
- Q: For file upload security validation (FR-14), what are the size limits? ‚Üí A: 10MB (small datasets, fast processing)
- Q: What are the expected performance targets for TARA analysis processing? ‚Üí A: Single asset <10s, Full model <5min, Batch >100/min
- Q: What user authentication method should the TARA platform support? ‚Üí A: No authentication (open access system)
- Q: In the AI-powered asset analysis process, what level of automation should the AutoGen system provide? ‚Üí A: Fully automated analysis with AI making all asset identification decisions
- Q: What data sources should the AI system use for asset identification decisions? ‚Üí A: Project documentation and user-provided configuration files
- Q: How should the AutoGen system process and structure the asset identification results? ‚Üí A: Output structured data matching ISO/SAE 21434 asset definition requirements
- Q: When AI encounters ambiguous or incomplete input data, how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Flag uncertain assets for manual review while proceeding with confident identifications
- Q: What confidence threshold and quality metrics should determine confident vs uncertain asset identifications? ‚Üí A: Multi-factor scoring based on data completeness, model confidence, and validation checks

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a cybersecurity analyst working on automotive systems, I need to perform comprehensive TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) processes to identify, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity risks in vehicle architectures according to ISO/SAE 21434 standards. I want to input my system data in various formats (Excel, CSV, JSON, or text) and receive structured outputs that guide my cybersecurity decisions and compliance documentation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have vehicle system data in Excel format, **When** I upload the file to AutoGT, **Then** the system validates the data structure and initiates the 8-step TARA process
2. **Given** I have completed asset definition and impact rating, **When** I proceed to threat scenario identification, **Then** the system presents relevant threat patterns based on my asset characteristics
3. **Given** I have completed all 8 TARA steps, **When** I request output generation, **Then** the system provides both structured JSON data and formatted Excel spreadsheet with risk assessment results
4. **Given** I have partial TARA analysis data, **When** I save my progress, **Then** I can resume the analysis later from the same step
5. **Given** I upload invalid or incomplete input data, **When** the system processes the file, **Then** I receive clear error messages indicating what data is missing or malformed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when uploaded files exceed size limits or contain malicious content?
- How does the system handle incomplete TARA processes that are abandoned mid-workflow?
- What occurs when threat databases are outdated or unavailable?
- How does the system respond to concurrent analysis sessions for the same vehicle system?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
