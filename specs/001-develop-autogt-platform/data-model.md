- Audit timestamp mixins on all entities
- Foreign key constraints with cascade deletes
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (asset_id, analysis_id)

**Migration Strategy:**

- Alembic for schema versioning
- Backward compatibility for 3-year audit retention
- Data migration scripts for ISO standard updates

**Performance Optimization:**

- Eager loading for related entities in TARA workflows
- Query optimization for batch processing >100 assets/minute
- Connection pooling for concurrent analysis sessions
