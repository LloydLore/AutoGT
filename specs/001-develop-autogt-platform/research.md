**Research Priority:** Low - Future implementation

## Google Gemini API Integration

**Decision**: Use Google Gemini Pro API as the primary LLM for TARA analysis  
**Rationale**: Gemini Pro offers strong analytical capabilities for cybersecurity domain knowledge, cost-effective pricing, and good performance for the automotive industry context. API stability and documentation quality support production use.  
**Alternatives considered**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, local models  

- OpenAI: Higher cost, rate limits may impact batch processing requirements  
- Claude: Limited API availability, uncertain automotive domain knowledge
- Local models: Performance constraints conflict with <10s single asset requirement

## Database Architecture

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (production)  
**Rationale**: SQLAlchemy provides strong ORM capabilities with type safety (aligns with constitution code quality requirements). SQLite enables easy development/testing, PostgreSQL scales for production workloads with 3-year audit retention requirements.  
**Alternatives considered**: Raw SQL, MongoDB, DuckDB  

- Raw SQL: Increases complexity, reduces type safety, conflicts with code quality standards
- MongoDB: TARA data is highly relational (assets→threats→risks), poor fit for document model
- DuckDB: Limited ecosystem, uncertain production stability for audit requirements

## CLI Framework Selection

**Decision**: Click framework with FastAPI for optional web interface  
**Rationale**: Click provides excellent CLI UX with command grouping, parameter validation, and help generation. FastAPI enables future web interface while maintaining CLI-first architecture. Both have strong type hint support.  
**Alternatives considered**: argparse, Typer, pure FastAPI CLI  

- argparse: Lower-level, more complex command structuring
- Typer: Good option but Click has broader ecosystem and more automotive industry usage
- Pure FastAPI CLI: Violates CLI-first principle, web-centric design

## File Processing Strategy

**Decision**: pandas for data manipulation with openpyxl for Excel, native JSON/CSV support  
**Rationale**: pandas excels at data transformation needed for TARA processing. openpyxl handles complex Excel formats common in automotive documentation. Memory-efficient streaming for 10MB file limit compliance.  
**Alternatives considered**: polars, pure Python parsing, Apache Arrow  

- polars: Faster but smaller ecosystem, less automotive industry adoption
- Pure Python: Reinventing data processing wheel, performance issues
- Apache Arrow: Overkill for file size constraints, complexity overhead

## Performance Architecture

**Decision**: Async/await patterns with concurrent.futures for CPU-bound TARA analysis  
**Rationale**: Async I/O for file handling and API calls, thread pools for CPU-intensive threat analysis calculations. Enables meeting <10s single asset, <5min full model targets while staying under 2GB memory.  
**Alternatives considered**: Synchronous processing, multiprocessing, Celery  

- Synchronous: Cannot meet performance targets for batch processing
- Multiprocessing: Memory overhead conflicts with 2GB constraint
- Celery: Infrastructure complexity violates simplicity principle

## ISO/SAE 21434 Compliance Implementation

**Decision**: Structured metadata throughout data models with explicit traceability fields  
**Rationale**: Every TARA entity (asset, threat, risk) includes ISO section references, audit timestamps, and decision rationale. Enables machine-readable compliance reporting and regulatory audit support.  
**Alternatives considered**: External compliance tracking, manual documentation  

- External tracking: Risk of sync issues between analysis and compliance data
- Manual documentation: Error-prone, conflicts with machine-readable requirement

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: pytest with pytest-asyncio, contract testing using OpenAPI validation, property-based testing for TARA algorithms  
**Rationale**: pytest ecosystem aligns with Python best practices. Contract testing ensures CLI/API interface stability. Property-based testing validates complex TARA calculations against automotive security requirements.  
**Alternatives considered**: unittest, custom test framework, manual testing  

- unittest: Less expressive than pytest, weaker fixture system
- Custom framework: Unnecessary complexity for proven testing patterns
- Manual testing: Conflicts with TDD constitutional requirement

## Deployment and Distribution

**Decision**: Python wheel distribution via PyPI, Docker containers for production deployment  
**Rationale**: Standard Python packaging enables easy installation across automotive development environments. Docker ensures consistent production deployment with dependency isolation.  
**Alternatives considered**: Executable binaries, conda packages, source-only distribution  

- Executables: Larger size, platform-specific builds increase maintenance
- Conda: Less universal than pip in enterprise automotive environments  
- Source-only: Complicates deployment, dependency management issues
